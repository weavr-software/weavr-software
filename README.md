## Weavr Software

**Product-focused software** — I like shipping clean, reliable MVPs and then iterating quickly.

- **Currently building**: **SimpleVet** (single-clinic MVP)
  - Staff auth + session persistence
  - Time/usage-limited public intake links
  - Client + pet management (search, details, notes/custom fields)

### What I work with

- **Languages**: TypeScript, Java
- **Focus**: web apps, APIs, pragmatic architecture, UX that doesn’t fight the user

### Featured work

- **Comfurtable**: `https://github.com/weavr-software/comfurtable`
- **Weavr Software homepage**: `https://github.com/weavr-software/weavr-software-homepage`
